Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors! 

I created this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This incorporates a lot of what I have been learning in my web programming course. 

If you click on rock, paper, or scissors, you will play a game against the computer. In the next version of the game, each user will be allowed 3 rounds. Now, play as many rounds as you wish. Enjoy!
